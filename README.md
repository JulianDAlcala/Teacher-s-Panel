# Software Requirements:

* Ubuntu 16.04
* Python 2.7 necessary libraries(mqtt,flask,xlrd)

# How to install

It´s neccesary to install the libraries as follows

* To install mqtt:
``` sh 
sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients 
```
This library is needed because it is a lightweight open network protocol that usually runs over tcp / ip which allows sending and receiving data via Wi-Fi and is perfect for IoT applications.

* to install paho-mqtt
``` sh 
pip install paho-mqtt
```
that library helps to implement versions 3.1 and 3.1.1 of the MQTT protocol.
* to install fask: 
``` sh 
sudo pip install flask
```
This library is where you can use the rasberry pi 3 to host the website i.e, the server where all the information will go.

* to install xlrd: 
``` sh
pip install xlrd"
```
With this library you will be able to link the excel documents with the website and thus be able to read the information files that will be run.
